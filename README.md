# vanilla-js-store
This is part of the functionality of the online store, which allows you to open products by category, view information about them, buy them and fill out a form that checks the correctness of the entered data.


In this project I used such technologies:


valilla js and DOM


Vite to build the project


API to get products and information about them


LocalStorage to cache data from the API


I use SASS  for creating styles
